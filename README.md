# Digital Drifters - Holiday Booking Website

## Description

Digital Drifters is a holiday booking website that allows users to research their flights directly from the website. It allows users to refine their search by city, date, and number of passengers. In addition, users can click on a page where they can get random travel inspiration and save the destinations they like to a favorites page for later use. The website is fully mobile responsive and uses React, Bootstrap, and two APIs.
