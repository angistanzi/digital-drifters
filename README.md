# Digital Drifters - Holiday Booking Website

## Description

Digital Drifters is a holiday booking website that allows users to research their flights directly from the website. It allows users to refine their search by city, date, and number of passengers. In addition, users can click on a page where they can get random travel inspiration and save the destinations they like to a favorites page for later use. The website is fully mobile responsive and uses React, Bootstrap, and two APIs.

## Installation

- Install Node.js: React is built on Node.js, so you need to install it first. You can download and install Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/.
- Clone the project: Clone the project repository using a Git client like Git Bash or GitHub Desktop. You can also download the project as a zip file and extract it.
- Install dependencies: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
- Start the app: Run the following command to start the app:
sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start the app and open it in your default web browser. If the app does not open automatically, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Usage

Please navigate through the website to view potential flights or to get travel inspiration, when you see a destination you like, favourite it to add it to the favourites page, and come back later to review them. If you want to immediately view flights from destinations in your favourites bar, there is a button to do so.
